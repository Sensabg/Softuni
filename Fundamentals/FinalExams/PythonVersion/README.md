I solved the tasks in Java, however, it appears that the contest is not configured to support different languages than Python at this point:

I was forced to convert my existing code to Python to determine if my logic developed in Java was valid.
Nonetheless, I had fun regardless of the existing obstacles.  Learning new tools, whether from your native tech stack or not
is rather enriching than harmful. Overall It was not a big deal anyway -greater benefits than invested efforts.
